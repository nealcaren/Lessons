    "Social scientists are often interested in collecting massive amounts of digital data from specific websites. When you are fortunate, someone else has already scrapped it for you and has released in on [GitHub](https://github.com) or as a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Sometimes the website provides an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API), an interface for collecting the data in a systematic way that is usually reasonably well-document. The most prominent of these for social scientists is probably [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html), who have enabled hundreds of academic studies by making available information about posts and users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, an API exists and is being used by the website, but information about is not publicly available. Most website searches, for example, involve using an internal web API. Your search term, along with other relevant parameters, is used to extract the corresponding results from a dataset and then displayed on a web page. While we see the data as part of a web page, the data is often transmitted in a different, more research-friend format, usually in a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. Using an undocumented API allows you to systematically collect the data without the parsing the HTML of each page. \n",
