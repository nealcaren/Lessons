    "## Assigning gender based on first name\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward task in natural language processing is to assign gender based on first name. Social scientists are often interested in gender inequalities and may have a dataset that lists name but not gender, such as a list of journal articles with authors in a study of gendered citation practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning gender based on name is usually done by comparing a given name with the name's gender distribution on official records, such as the US Social Security baby name list. While this works for most names, some names, such as Gershun or Hunna, are too rare to have reliable estimates based on most available official records. Other names, such as Jian or Blake, are common among both men and women. A fourth category of names are those which are dispropriately one gender or another, but do have non-trivial numbers of a different gender, such as Cody or Kyle. For both these names and androgynous names, their are often generational differences in the gendered distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient way to gender names in Python is with the `gender_guesser` library, which is based on JÃ¶rg Michael's multinational list of more than 48,000 names. The first time you use the library, you may need to install it:\n",
